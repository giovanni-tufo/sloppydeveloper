# The Sloppy Developer Manifesto

We are sick of Agile. We are sick of Scrum. We don't want to write tests, because no one reads tests. My code is good, you don't need to review it.

1. new features should be tested only by end users on production
2. the code is always working as it is coded
2. everything works fine on my machine
3. deploy first. Fix eventually.
4. If a test fails, test is adjusted in a way that it doesn't fail anymore
5. If test can't be fixed, remove it.
5. there is no better tester in real-life than the end user
6. FTP is good enough, don't waste time in CD/CI
7. using git is waste of time. copy paste folders with timestamp
8. Backups cost money, save your bucks for beer
